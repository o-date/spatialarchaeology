Archaeological survey in particular relies on the collection and analysis of spatial data to understand patterns across whole areas of the landscape. Are most sites in a given landscape from a particular period? Are there more cairns than anything else? Are sites from all periods represented equally? These are the kinds of questions one might as using survey data. \n",
